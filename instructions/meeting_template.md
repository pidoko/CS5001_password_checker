# Meeting Template

Go through this template in preparation for your meeting with the course staff member. We are not grading you on this template, just will help with questions and discussion. Please note, staff have the right to ask you to schedule a second meeting. The goal is to help you flesh out a reasonable project for this course, so make sure to use these meetings as a resource!

## Project Ideas
What are some ideas for your project? Why does that interest you?

## What are the big ideas?
How does this address some of the big learning ideas of 5001?

## Code Design Thoughts
Are you including classes or APIs, what about dictionaries? One of the worst things you can do is go into a project assuming you are going to 'hard' code everything (this happens often with text based games, then students get stuck). You don't have to know details yet, but you should think about separation of concerns, and how to divide up your code. 

## Resources Found
What are some resources you have found already or already have access to? (APIs, libraries, past assignments, etc)

## Timeline
Setup a general timeline that includes research and development, and when you want to have certain aspects of the project done.
